### Project Description
PenEnd is a fun and interactive tool that helps you estimate how many words your pen can still write based on its current ink level. Simply select your pen type, adjust the ink level slider, and the site will calculate the estimated remaining word count. If your ink is running low, you'll get a warning ‚Äî complete with sound ‚Äî letting you know your pen is about to die!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
To check how many words can be written before pen dies.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
This website estimates how many words your pen can still write based on the ink level you choose. Pick your pen type, slide the ink meter, and we‚Äôll do the math! If you're low on ink, you‚Äôll get a dramatic warning ‚Äî complete with sound.
